          <p>This is an introduction to a hair dying guide. Learn all about how we apply color theory to dying our hair, what lifting or striping the color of your hair means, and how to do it at hair with your own discretion.</p>
          <p>First we'll delve into the foundational knowledge of dying your hair. Next we'll look into the chemistry behind hair dying and how understanding science allows us to deepen our knowledge of bleaching and coloring our hair. We'll also look into different style types, so that you can choose the perfect style for you. Finally, we'll delve into the logistics of how to actually dye your own hair (again at your own disrection) and how to take care of it.</p>
          <p>It's important to do your research and know what each aspect of hair dying means, if you choose to do it at home. However, if you would just like foundational knowledge about dying your hair before making the trip to salon you are at the right place. It's essential to know what exactly you're getting yourself into. </p>
          <code>All in all, I always recommend experimenting with your hair and trying new things. </code>

          <p>Color theory explains how colors work together; how they interact; and how they mix. For example, if you've ever looked at a color wheel you would notice what colors lay next to each other and what colors sit across from one another. For example, red and green are complementary colors because they sit across from each other on the color wheel. But they will also cancel each other out. The same with blue and orange and purple and yellow. </p>
          <p>So, how does this relate to dying your hair? Let's say you have the base color to dye your hair blue (we'll go more into this later but your hair will have to be lifted to blonde, if it's not already there). The undertones of that hairdye will determine how the color will fade out. In most cases blue fades out into a green from hair washing. Once your hair has reached this faded out color, sure you can add blue on top again, or you can add red to it and your hair will be red. That is because green and red cancel out one another. So even though your hair was previously blue, it has now become a green color that will allow you to experiment with another color, such as red. </p>
          <p>Another important detail to know about dying hair is the lift or level of your hair. If your hair is super blonde, your lift level will likely be at a 9 or a 10. However, if your hair is black or brown your lift level will be closer to a 1 or 2. Lift level is important because you cannot deposit hair dye onto dark hair. It will only appear on lighter hair. If you already have blonde hair, lucky you! You most likely won't have to lift your hair with bleach and developer. However, if you have black or brown hair you will have to lift the levels of your hair by applying bleach or developer. This <strong>will</strong> cause damage to your hair. It's important to experiment with a test strand first to see how your hair reacts to bleach and developer.</p>
          <p>There are varying levels to bleach and developer. The typical standard for developer is 10-40 volume. You should start off with 10 or 20 developer first on your test strand to see how your hair reacts AND how much your hair will lift. You will have to mix your bleach and developer together (make sure to look at the instructions for ratios) to create a formula that will strip the color from your hair and lift it. The first round of bleach will likely turn your hair orange or yellow. The amount of rounds of bleach you do is dependent on how much your hair lifts. It's important to space out time to allow your hair to heal before doing another round.</p>
          <p>Then there is toner. This is also damaging to your hair so proceed with caution. Toner will neutralize unwanted tones in your hair. For example, if your hair is yellow you'll likely use a toner with purple undertones to get rid of all that uneveness and unwanted yellow tones. This will likely get your hair closer to that blonde color that you want(color theory!!). You can also use it to get different colors other than blonde, like neutralizing the orange tones of your hair.  </p>

          <p>Melanins are the most widely occurring pigments in nature. In addition to giving hair its color, melanins give color to eyes, freckles, skin, scales, and feathers. They are also responsible for the browning of plants. However, melanin is important for more than just hair color. This biopolymer is able to bind drugs just as receptors bind to drugs. In order to understand how this happens, it is helpful to understand how melanin is made and its basic structure.</p>
          <p>And finally, some chemistry: within the melanocytes, melanin is synthesized from tyrosine, a naturally occurring amino acid that is also found in neurons where it participates in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, dopamine. Different enzymes are found in melanocytes and in dopamine neurons to synthesize melanin or dopamine from the same starting material (tyrosine). For example, with the help of the enzyme tyrosinase and some copper, tyrosine is oxidized by O2 eventually into special dopaquinones that have color</p>

          <header>Types of styles to dye your hair</header>
          <p>There are so many ways to dye your hair a certain style. It all depends on what kind of look you want. For example, do you want something more natural or something more exotic? Do you want to stick to neutral, basic colors to add highlight to your hair, or do you want to experiment with more exotic, vibrant colors? </p>
          <p> I will list out the types of styles to dye your hair if you want to stick to a more natural look. Note that you can also do these styles with exotic colors.
                <li>
                    Balayage: A soft, sun-kissed look 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Highlights: Sections of your hair are colored a lighter color to highlight your hair.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lowlights: Similar to highlights, however, it adds more depth and volume to your hair.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Babylights: These are fine streaks in your hair, similar to highlights but imagine much finer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ombre: Think of your natural hair fading out into a lighter hair color. An ombre effect will make this look natural. 
                </li>
          </p>
          <p> Next, I will list types of styles to dye your hair if you are looking to do something more exotic.
                <li>
                    Skunk highlights: This style is chunky and bold highlights.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Skunk tail: This is typically done to one section of your hair that is dyed an exotic color that differs from the rest of your hair. Like if you dyed a left side section of your hair pink and the rest of your hair is black. You can also experiment with strips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shadow roots: This is where the roots of your hair is a different color than the rest of your hair. Like the roots being pink and the rest of your hair is black.
                </li>

          <header>How to dye your hair</header>
          <p> This will be a very basic guide to dying your hair. I suggest doing further research and watching videos as well to visualize the process of dying hair. </p>
          <p> Step 1. Prepare your ingredients. You will need bleach and developer to lift the color of your hair, if necessary. You will also need your hair dye, a sectioning comb, a bowl to mix, and a brush applicator. You will also need gloves, an apron or towel, and some type of bag to trap the heat in when bleaching your hair
          </p>
          <p>Step 2. If you are not lifting the color of your hair skip this part. Mix your bleach and developer (follow the instructions for ratios) together. Section your hair depending on what style you want. You will directly apply the mixed solution onto the sections of your hair. Make sure that each section is well coated in bleach/developer and that it is coated evenly. Do not lather the bleach/developer into your hair. You will let the mix sit in your hair for 30-45 minutes. Put your hair in a bag or a cap to trap in the heat to allow the bleach to lift. Remember that it is recommended to wait for your hair to heal before doing another round of bleach. Wash it out. You can apply toner once your hair has dried, or you can blow dry it to speed up the process</p>
          <p>Step 3. Once the color of your hair is lifted, or if your hair is already at the necessary lift level, apply your hair dye to the bleached sections of your hair. Wait 25-30 minutes before washing the color out of your hair. </p>
          <code>Step 4. Your hair is dyed!</code>

          <header>Maintenance</header>
          <p>This part is very important if you want to maintain the color of your hair and heal the damage the bleach did to your hair.</p>
          <p>To maintain the color of your hair, you will have to recolor your hair because the color will fade out. Look into brands that sell good hair dyes where the color will take longer to fade out. You can also use shampoos and conditioners that are meant to protect hair dye from fading. It is also recommended to shower with cold water rather than hot water to prevent color fading.</p>
          <p>To heal the damage done to your hair if you bleached it you will have to use many hair masks and deep conditioning masks. Use shampoo and conditioners meant to heal damaged hair, and try not to bleach your hair again. The more you take care of your hair the more it'll heal. </p>
